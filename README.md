# Wearable IoT for Distress Detection and Emergency Control 
Refers to a smart wearable device that can detect emergencies or distress situations and automatically trigger an alert or take corrective actions, often through IoT (Internet of Things) technology. This concept combines wearable technology (e.g., smartwatches, fitness trackers, or custom-built devices) with IoT to enable real-time monitoring, alerting, and control during emergency situations.

The hardware worn by the user, like a smartwatch, fitness band, or a custom wearable device, equipped with features such as push buttons, GPS, and wireless communication modules (e.g., GSM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

Typically, the device will have a physical button that the user presses during an emergency. This button triggers a signal to notify emergency contacts or services.

AI or machine learning algorithms can be integrated to automatically detect distress by analyzing various parameters (e.g., Emotion analysis).

The wearable device often uses GSM/SIM cards for sending distress alerts via SMS or calls. It may also use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to the internet or nearby smart devices for further actions.
